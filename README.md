# Forecasting-the-Success-of-Turkish-Television-Series

## Project Description
This project aims to predict when the next seasons of Turkish TV series will be released and classify the series based on these predictions. By utilizing machine learning and data analytics techniques, predictions are made about the release times of series, and the series are classified accordingly.

## Data Collection
The data used for the project is obtained from various sources, including IMDb, official websites of TV channels, and social media platforms. Reliable data from trusted sources are used in the data collection process.

## Machine Learning
The project predicts the release dates of future seasons of series using various machine learning algorithms. These algorithms include decision trees, linear regression, and deep learning methods. The model performance is evaluated with various metrics, and the most suitable model is selected.

## Results
The results of the project include the predicted season release dates and the list of classified series. Additionally, statistical information about the accuracy and performance of the model is provided.
